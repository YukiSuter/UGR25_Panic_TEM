# UGR25_Panic_ESP_TEM

Welcome to this god awful repo.

This was something we bodged to heck after noise infiltrated our Orion TEM. 

None of us want to see this code again, and neither should you.

## Editing and Building This Code

This code is edited and built using VSCode, with the PlatformIO extension. Rather unusually, the board used was an ESP32 due to its abundance of AnalogIn pins. The framework used therefore was Arduino, so syntax changes may be preset between the code here and other frameworks such as mbed.
